Question and Ashton is a weekly podcast by [Ashton Kemerling](http://www.ashtonkemerling.com). Ashton knows way too much about way too many things, and would like to share the ~~burden~~ joy of knowing everything with you!

Each episode starts with a question that Ashton will then answer, although he makes no promises to staying on topic. These are questions that either knows too much about already, or questions that Ashton has been asked in his everyday life.

Official discussion, as well as an opportunity to discuss recent episodes is on the official subreddit for this podcast, at [/r/questionandashton](https://www.reddit.com/r/questionandashtion/).
