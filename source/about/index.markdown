Question & Ashton is a weekly podcast
by [Ashton Kemerling](http://www.ashtonkemerling.com) dedicated to talking about
the history and technology of everything. Ashton is a bit of a "know it all"
that has decided to turn his abilities for good, educating you about practically
everything.

The podcast is laid out in a series format, with each series covering a single
subject. Within each series there will be a number of episodes, each dedicated
to a small portion of the topic, like a particular inventor, time period, or
invention.

The official discussion for this podcast will be on Reddit at
the [questionandashton](https://www.reddit.com/r/questionandashton) subreddit.
There will be an official post for each episode there.
